# Elemactary-Dark
MacOS Style theme for ElementaryOS

[Elemactary-Dark](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1406950/)

this is just for Elementary OS, it's based on default EOS dark theme and ElementaryX theme. 
default EOS theme had some problem with dark mode. and ElementaryX had some blueish accent which i didn't like, so i made my own version. 
i also replaced button files with SVG.

download the [file](https://github.com/saint-13/Elemactary-Dark/releases/download/Elemactary/Elemactary-Dark-v1.1.zip), extract it, and put it in: /usr/share/themes
change your theme from: setting > tweaks > GTK+ > Elemactary-Dark

hope you like it.
