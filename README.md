# Elemactary-Dark
<b>MacOS Style theme for ElementaryOS</b>

[Elemactary-Dark](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1406950/)

THIS THEME IS JUST FOR Elementary OS!

may work on other DEs, BUT not guaranteed.

[Versoin 2.0](https://github.com/saint-13/Elemactary-Dark/releases/download/Elemactary_2.0_BETA/Elemactary-v2.0-Beta.zip) works best in ElementaryOS 6 :

it's based on default EOS theme.different highlight colors (e.g: Strawberry, Coco,...) are included. it's in Beta version, so some apps (e.g: calculator) may don't have correct theme. if you find bugs, please report to me.

[Versoin 1.2](https://github.com/saint-13/Elemactary-Dark/releases/download/Elemactary_1.2/Elemactary-Dark-v1.2.zip) works best in ElementaryOS 5 :

it's based on default EOS dark theme and ElementaryX theme, default EOS theme had some problem with dark mode. and ElementaryX had some blueish accent which i didn't like, so i made my own version.

download the file, extract it, and put it in: /usr/share/themes
change your theme from:
setting > tweaks > GTK+ > Elemactary-Dark

hope you like it.
